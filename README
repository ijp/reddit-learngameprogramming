My homework for http://www.reddit.com/r/learngameprogramming/ as
username 'shotintheface'.

Solutions are written in Guile Scheme 2 using guile-SDL and are not
written to be portable.

This code, like guile-SDL, is published under the terms of the GNU
General Public License, version 3 or later. See COPYING for detail.

To obtain a copy of guile 2, please visit
http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/ as it may not have been packaged
for your linux distribution yet.
I also recommend you use the copy of guile-sdl from
http://github.com/downloads/ijp/reddit-learngameprogramming/guile-sdl-bt.tar.gz
as there hasn't been a release since 2009.
